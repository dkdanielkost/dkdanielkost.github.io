<h3>Exploratory Data Analysis and Visualization</h3>
<p>The second team assignment in the Exploratory Data Analysis and Visualization class focused on exploratory analysis of flood data taken over the course of the past 30 years. My contributions were some of the wordclouds as well as the marked map and interactive choropleth maps.</br>

The final project in my exploratory data analysis and visualization class involved exploratory analysis of 311 complains around the NYC area. My contributions included the animated density gif (with colored histogram) and the nine complaint reconstructions (for noise, taxis and plumbing) by zip code. I also dedicated a significant amount of time to the modelling portion of the project.</br>
